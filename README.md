### Private Events

## This project is an events page, that allows you to create events and send invitations to other users using the person username, everyone has the chance to see their event invitations using the links on the navigation bar on top, also it's possible to filter only the events you have created. On the invitations page, you can also see all the events you have been invited to and filter them by future events or previous events. People need to be logged in to do any changes, the post has the option to edit or delete, and on each post you can see the people you have invited to your event, but make sure not to send too many invitations because each event have a maximum amount of people and once that is fill, no more invitations can be accepted.
