### Private Events

This project is a calendar event page made with ruby on rails, that allows you to create events and select a date, name, set a limit of people for the event.

Also, you can send invitations to users, then each user can see their invitations on a notifications area.

Once an event is created the owner can edit it, delete and have control over the people who have accepted the invitation or remove people from the list.

Invited users can see a list of the people who will attend the event on the event description page and also can refuse or cancel an accepted invitation.

Users can see all the events they have attended and upcoming events. These two options also apply to the events you create.
